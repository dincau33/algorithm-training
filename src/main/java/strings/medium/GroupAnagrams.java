 * Write a function that takes in an array of strings and returns a list of groups of anagrams.
 * Anagrams are strings made up of exactly the same letters, where order doesn't matter.
 * For example, "cinema" and "iceman" are anagrams; similarly, "foo" and "ofo" are anagrams.
 * Note that the groups aof anagrams don't need to be ordered in any particular way.
